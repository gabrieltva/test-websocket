# Just a WebSocket Test

I'm making a test how to connect and consume WebSocket service.

## What I need?

To test this app is necessary to have NodeJS installed in your machine.

## How to config

- Run `npm install` in the root dir;
- Run `npm install` in the `/server` dir;

## How to run the project

- Run `npm run dev` in both directory `/` and `/server`;
